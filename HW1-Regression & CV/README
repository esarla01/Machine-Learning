## Overview
This project explores core machine learning concepts, including regression, cross-validation, and regularization, through tasks that focus on building and evaluating models to predict vehicle fuel efficiency (mpg) based on various vehicle characteristics.

## Tasks
1. Code Tasks:
    - Implement Python functions for performance metrics (e.g., RMSE), linear regression, and cross-validation.
    - Code completion includes the creation of functions for model fitting, prediction, and validation.
2. Data Analysis:
    - Analyze vehicle data (horsepower, weight, etc.) to build predictive models.
    - Implement polynomial regression, penalized regression, and cross-validation to refine model performance.

## Objectives
- Understand the mechanics of linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularization techniques like Ridge.
- Use cross-validation to assess model performance and select the best hyperparameters.
- Apply error metrics such as RMSE for model evaluation.

## Methodology
- Implement core functionalities in `performance_metrics.py`, `LeastSquaresLinearRegression.py`, and `cross_validation.py`.
- Use sklearn's tools in conjunction with custom implementations to perform regression analysis and evaluate results across training, validation, and test datasets.

## Report
- Problem 1: Polynomial Regression — Evaluate the impact of polynomial degree on model performance.
- Problem 2: Penalized Polynomial Regression — Use Ridge regularization to improve model performance.
- Problem 3: Cross-Validation — Use 10-fold cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and select the best model.

## Results
- Key Findings: Best polynomial degree for predicting mpg, optimal regularization strength (alpha), and comparisons between different models.
- Deliverables:
    - Python code in a ZIP file
    - PDF report summarizing analysis and findings
